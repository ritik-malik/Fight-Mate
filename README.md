# Fight-Mate
### IED 3rd Project
Fightmate is used to learn boxing in the absence of a professional trainer. You can ask any of your friends to land a punch on you. The 2 bands on your wrist will tell you the best move i.e the optimum move to avoid the punch and hit back. https://sites.google.com/iiitd.ac.in/â€¦
